# Use Cases

## Overview

The Use Cases section primarily focuses on analyzing scenarios where Reactive Smart Contracts might be a game changer.

The [Basic Demo Smart Contract](use-case-1.md) is a basic use case of the Reactive Network enabling low-latency event monitoring, capturing logs from origin chain contracts, processing them, and triggering callbacks on the destination chain.

The [Deploying Reactive Smart Contracts with Remix](remix-ide-demo.mdx) article is a guide for deploying a Reactive Smart Contract using the Remix Development Environment.

The [Uniswap V2 Stop Order Demo](use-case-3.md) is a demo of a simple reactive smart contract that implements a stop order upon a Uniswap V2 liquidity pool. Study its setup and try deploying and testing it yourself.

The [Approval Magic Demo](use-case-2.md) extends reactive and subscription-based concepts to implement an approval-based token exchange across multiple chains.

If you have an idea for another use case, feel free to submit and turn it into a bounty, using our [Unicornization](https://reactive.network/unicornization) program.

# Use Cases

## Overview

The Use Cases section primarily focuses on analyzing scenarios where Reactive Smart Contracts might be a game changer.

The [Basic Demo Smart Contract](use-case-1.md) is a basic use case of the Reactive Network with low-latency monitoring of logs emitted by arbitrary contracts on any chain (Sepolia testnet in this case) and enabling calls from the Reactive Network to these arbitrary chain contracts.

The [Deploying Reactive Smart Contracts with Remix](remix-ide-demo.md) article is a guide walking you through deploying Reactive Smart Contracts using the Remix Development Environment.

The [Uniswap V2 Stop Order Demo](use-case-3.md) is a demo of a simple reactive smart contract that implements a stop order upon a Uniswap V2 liquidity pool. Study its setup and try deploying and testing it yourself.

## Environment Setup

To set up the foundry environment, run:

```
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
source ~/.bashrc
foundryup
```

Install dependencies:

```
forge install
```

## Development & Testing

To compile artifacts:

```
forge compile
```

To run the test suite:

```
forge test -vv
```

To inspect the call tree:

```
forge test -vvvv
```

## Environment Variable Configuration

The following environment variables are used in the instructions for running the demos and should be configured beforehand.

`SEPOLIA_RPC`

RPC address for Sepolia testnet, `https://rpc2.sepolia.org` unless you want to use your own.

`SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY`

Private key to your Sepolia wallet.

`REACTIVE_RPC`

RPC address for Reactive testnet, which should be set to `https://kopli-rpc.reactive.network/`.

`REACTIVE_PRIVATE_KEY`

The private key to your Reactive wallet.

`DEPLOYER_ADDR`

The address of your Reactive wallet.

`SYSTEM_CONTRACT_ADDR`

System contract address for Reactive testnet, which should be set to `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000FFFFFF`.

`CALLBACK_SENDER_ADDR`

Refer to the documentation for addresses used by Reactive testnet for callbacks on supported networks.

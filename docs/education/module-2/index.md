# Module 2: Intermediate - Building Blocks for Reactivity

# Overview

Welcome to Module 2: Intermediate - Building Blocks for Reactivity! In this module, we're diving into decentralized finance (DeFi), with a focus on understanding and applying Reactive Smart Contracts (RSCs).

[Lesson 6: Understanding Uniswap V2 Pools and Smart Contracts](how-uniswap-works.md)

Gain an understanding of Uniswap V2, a key decentralized finance protocol. Learn how liquidity pools function and explore the smart contracts that drive Uniswap V2, enabling efficient and decentralized trading.

[Lesson 7: Implementing Basic Reactive Functions](basic-reactive-functions.md)

Explore how Reactive Smart Contracts (RSCs) operate within the DeFi space. Understand how RSCs can autonomously execute trades and respond to specific conditions, improving the capabilities of decentralized applications.

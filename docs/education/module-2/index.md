# Module 2: Intermediate - Building Blocks for Reactivity

# Overview

Welcome to Module 2: Intermediate - Building Blocks for Reactivity! In this module, we're diving into the world of decentralized
finance (DeFi) and gearing up for some serious action within the blockchain domain.

[Lesson 5](how-uniswap-works.md) guides you through the complex labyrinth of Uniswap V2, a decentralized finance protocol
that's like the ultimate loot box for blockchain enthusiasts. Unravel the mysteries of Uniswap V2 pools, where
liquidity is the name of the game, and smart contracts are the magical spells that keep everything running smoothly.

[Lesson 6](basic-reactive-functions.md) takes it up a notch by unleashing the power of Reactive Smart Contracts (RSCs) onto
the battlefield. Walk through the ins and outs of RSCs in the world of DeFi and see how they autonomously execute trades based
on specific conditions.

By the end of this module, you'll have a solid understanding of the foundational concepts, functionalities, and applications of
Reactive Smart Contracts, all within the context of DeFi and Uniswap V2.

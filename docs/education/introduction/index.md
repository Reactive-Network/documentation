## Overview

To better understand the concept of Reactive Smart Contracts (RSCs), we have developed an educational course featuring detailed lectures, code snippets on [GitHub](https://github.com/Reactive-Network/reactive-smart-contract-demos/tree/main/src/demos), and video workshops on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@0xReactive/streams). Our goal is to provide both theoretical knowledge and practical challenges, creating a community where developers can fully explore RSCs.

## Where to Begin 

The Introduction chapter provides an overview of Reactive Smart Contracts, highlighting their ability to autonomously react to events on EVM-compatible chains. It also outlines the technical and knowledge prerequisites necessary for mastering these concepts.

[Prerequisites →](./prerequisites.md)

## Module One

[Module 1](../module-1/index.md) is dedicated to the basics of Reactive Smart Contracts, events and callbacks, the ReactVM and Reactive Network environments, subscriptions, and the function of oracles in integrating off-chain data.

[Reactive Smart Contracts →](../module-1/reactive-smart-contracts.md)

[How Events and Callbacks Work →](../module-1/how-events-work.md)

[ReactVM and Reactive Network →](../module-1/react-vm.md)

[How Subscriptions Work →](../module-1/subscriptions.md)

[How Oracles Work →](../module-1/how-oracles-work.md)

## Module Two

[Module 2](../module-2/index.md) explores Uniswap V2, focusing on liquidity pools and smart contract operations. It also elaborates on the basic functions of Reactive Smart Contracts that enable autonomous execution.

[How Uniswap Works →](../module-2/how-uniswap-works.md)

[Basic Reactive Functions →](../module-2/basic-reactive-functions.md)

## Use Cases

The [Use Cases](../use-cases/index.md) section explains scenarios where Reactive Smart Contracts can improve blockchain apps. It includes a basic demo for low-latency log monitoring and interaction across different chains, a guide on deploying RSCs using Remix, and a demonstration of a stop order implementation on a Uniswap V2 liquidity pool.

## Glossary

The Glossary provides concise definitions of key terms related to blockchain technology, decentralized finance, and smart contracts, including specific Reactive terms to prevent potential confusion.

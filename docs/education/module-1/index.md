# Module 1: Beginner — Foundations of Reactive Smart Contracts

# Overview

Welcome to Module 1: Beginner — Foundations of Reactive Smart Contracts (RSCs)! This module introduces the core concepts and functionalities of RSCs, providing a foundation for applying them in blockchain projects.

[Lesson 1: Reactive Smart Contracts](reactive-smart-contracts.md)

Explore the mechanisms of RSCs, focusing on their reactive nature and Inversion of Control. Learn through use cases such as data collection with oracles and executing stop orders on decentralized exchanges.

[Lesson 2: How Events and Callbacks Work](how-events-work.md)

Understand how EVM events and callbacks enable interaction between smart contracts and external systems. Includes a practical example of Chainlink's price oracle integration.

[Lesson 3: ReactVM and Reactive Network As a Dual-State Environment](react-vm.md)

Examine the dual-state environment of RSCs within the Reactive Network and ReactVM. Learn about state management and transaction execution across these domains.

[Lesson 4: How Subscriptions Work](subscriptions.md)

Learn about setting up and managing subscriptions in RSCs to streamline event handling and automate contract execution.

[Lesson 5: How Oracles Work](how-oracles-work.md)

Discover the role of oracles in connecting blockchain with off-chain data. Explore multisig protocols and practical applications in DeFi, insurance, and online betting.

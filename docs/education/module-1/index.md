# Module 1: Beginner — Foundations of Reactive Smart Contracts

# Overview

Welcome to Module 1: Beginner — Foundations of Reactive Smart Contracts (RSCs)! Get ready to level up your blockchain skills
as we step into the realm of RSCs!

[Lesson 1](reactive-smart-contracts.md) unfolds the mechanisms of RSCs, where code meets action in a dynamic and reactive
environment. Discover the concept of Inversion of Control as RSCs autonomously respond to blockchain events. Through thrilling
use cases like data collection with oracles and executing stop orders on decentralized exchanges, you'll harness the full
potential of RSCs.

[Lesson 2](react-vm.md) unveils the dual-state landscape of RSCs, where contracts exist simultaneously in the Reactive
Network and ReactVM. Navigate through these parallel dimensions and understand how to wield the power of state management and
transaction execution on the blockchain. With examples that blur the boundaries between both domains, you'll grasp the
intricacies of managing state and executing actions within RSCs.

[Lesson 3](how-events-work.md) explores the secrets of EVM events, the hidden treasures that drive interaction between smart
contracts and the external world. Dive deep into the mechanics of event emission and storage with a practical example
demonstrating Chainlink's price oracle integration.

[Lesson 4](how-oracles-work.md) unravels the mysteries of oracles, the legendary gatekeepers between the blockchain and
off-chain data sources, which enable smart contracts to access real-world information securely and reliably. With insights
into multisig protocols and practical applications in DeFi, insurance, and online betting, you'll learn about the pivotal role
of oracles in expanding the capabilities of blockchain applications.

By the end of this module, you'll have a solid understanding of the foundational concepts, functionalities, and applications
of Reactive Smart Contracts.

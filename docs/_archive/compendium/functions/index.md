# Functions 

# Overview

The Functions section provides a description of the core functions within reactive, origin, and destination smart contracts.
These functions are critical for initializing contracts, managing event-driven reactions, and executing transactions on platforms
like Uniswap V2. Each function plays a specific role in ensuring interaction and efficient event handling within the blockchain
ecosystem.

## Overview

Kopli Testnet is a proof-of-stake testnet, representing Reactive Network's pre-alpha / Proof-of-Concept era. This Testnet, neither trustless nor decentralized, is fully managed by Reactive Team. It is designed only for testing purposes. Further decentralization is assured and scheduled for implementation in later stages.

## Callback Proxy Address

`CALLBACK_PROXY_ADDR` ensures the validity of a callback transaction by checking two key conditions:

- **Reactive Network Signature**: Verifies that the callback is initiated by the Reactive Network by matching the sender address to `CALLBACK_PROXY_ADDR`.

- **RVM ID Verification**: Confirms that the callback originates from the correct reactive contract by checking the RVM ID in the transaction payload.

Callback proxy addresses can be found in [Origins & Destinations](./origins-and-destinations.mdx#chains)

## Get Kopli Testnet REACT

To receive REACT tokens, send SepETH to the Reactive faucet contract on Ethereum Sepolia (`0x9b9BB25f1A81078C544C829c5EB7822d747Cf434`). An equivalent amount of REACT will be sent to your address, up to a 0.1 ETH limit, assuming the faucet has funds. You can use MetaMask or any compatible wallet for the transfer.

Alternatively, users can call the `request(address)` method on the Reactive faucet contract on Sepolia (`0x9b9BB25f1A81078C544C829c5EB7822d747Cf434`) to transfer REACT tokens to any specified address on Kopli Testnet. This requires sending the appropriate SepETH amount.

```bash
cast send 0x9b9BB25f1A81078C544C829c5EB7822d747Cf434 --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC --private-key $SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY "request(address)" $KOPLI_TESTNET_ADDR --value $0.1ether
```

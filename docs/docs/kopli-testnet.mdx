## Get REACT tokens

To receive REACT tokens, send SepETH to the Reactive faucet contract on Ethereum Sepolia (`0x9b9BB25f1A81078C544C829c5EB7822d747Cf434`). An equivalent amount of REACT will be sent to your address, up to a 0.1 ETH limit, assuming the faucet has funds. You can use MetaMask or any compatible wallet for the transfer.

Alternatively, users can call the `request(address)` method on the Reactive faucet contract on Sepolia (`0x9b9BB25f1A81078C544C829c5EB7822d747Cf434`) to transfer REACT tokens to any specified contract on Reactive Kopli.

```bash
cast send 0x9b9BB25f1A81078C544C829c5EB7822d747Cf434 --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC --private-key $SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY "request(address)" $CONTRACT_ADDR --value 0.1ether
```

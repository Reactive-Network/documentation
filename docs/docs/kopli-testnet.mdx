## Overview

Kopli Testnet is a proof-of-stake testnet, representing Reactive Network's pre-alpha / Proof-of-Concept era. This Testnet, neither trustless nor decentralized, is fully managed by Reactive Team. It is designed only for testing purposes. Further decentralization is assured and scheduled for implementation in later stages.

## Callback Proxy Address

`CALLBACK_PROXY_ADDR` ensures the validity of a callback transaction by checking two key conditions:

- **Reactive Network Signature**: Verifies that the callback is initiated by the Reactive Network by matching the sender address to `CALLBACK_PROXY_ADDR`.

- **RVM ID Verification**: Confirms that the callback originates from the correct reactive contract by checking the RVM ID in the transaction payload.

Callback proxy addresses can be found in [Origins & Destinations](./origins-and-destinations.mdx#chains)

## Get Kopli Testnet REACT

The first method is ideal for cases where the address initiating the transfer is also the recipient. Users can acquire REACT tokens on the Reactive Network (RN) by interacting with the Reactive faucet contract. Transfer SepETH directly to the faucet contract on the Sepolia Network. Upon completion, an equivalent number of REACT tokens will be transferred to the sender's address on the Reactive Network. This transfer is subject to a predefined limit (0.1 ETH by default) and assumes the faucet has available funds. The process can be executed using MetaMask or any other wallet.

Alternatively, users can call the payable method `request(address)` on the Reactive Faucet Contract on Sepolia to transfer REACT tokens directly to a specified RN address. In that case, users must provide the corresponding amount of SepETH when invoking this method. This approach is suitable for situations where the address initiating the transfer is not necessarily the recipient on the Reactive Network, allowing for flexible token transfers across different addresses.

```bash
cast send $REACTIVE_FAUCET_L1_ADDR "request(address)" $REACTIVE_TARGET_ADDR --value $WEI_AMOUNT --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC --private-key $SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY
```

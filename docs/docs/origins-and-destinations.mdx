## Overview

The Reactive Network reads event streams and enables transactions across different ecosystems. An Origin acts as an event log provider, delivering events to reactive contracts within the Reactive Network. A Destination is the ecosystem where the actual state transition (transaction) takes place.

Origins and destinations don't have to be the same. Reactive contracts can be configured to work with multiple origins, and the system allows for multiple destinations, enabling conditional selection of which destination ecosystem will be used.

## Callback Proxy Address

The Callback Proxy address ensures the validity of a callback transaction by enforcing two key conditions. First, it checks that the callback is genuinely initiated by the Reactive Network by verifying that the sender address matches the Callback Proxy address. Then, it confirms the legitimacy of the callback’s origin by checking the RVM ID embedded in the transaction payload, which should correspond to the intended reactive contract.

## Hyperlane Mailbox

In addition to using callback senders, you can integrate Hyperlane Mailboxes. A Hyperlane Mailbox is a smart contract designed to send and receive verified cross-chain messages between blockchains, providing a secure and standardized mechanism for interchain communication.

See our [Hyperlane Demo](https://github.com/Reactive-Network/reactive-smart-contract-demos/tree/main/src/demos/hyperlane) to understand how to deploy contracts and send messages with Hyperlane mailboxes.

## Overview

The Reactive Network reads event streams and enables transactions across different ecosystems. An Origin acts as an event log provider, delivering events to reactive contracts within the Reactive Network. A Destination is the ecosystem where the actual state transition (transaction) takes place.

Origins and destinations don't have to be the same. Reactive contracts can be configured to work with multiple origins, and the system allows for multiple destinations, enabling conditional selection of which destination ecosystem will be used.

## Callback Proxy Address

`CALLBACK_PROXY_ADDR` ensures the validity of a callback transaction by checking two key conditions:

- **Reactive Network Signature**: Verifies that the callback is initiated by the Reactive Network by matching the sender address to `CALLBACK_PROXY_ADDR`.

- **RVM ID Verification**: Confirms that the callback originates from the correct reactive contract by checking the RVM ID in the transaction payload.

## Reactive Mainnet Chains

:::info[Callbacks]
Not all origin chains are compatible as destination chains. Please refer to the table below before implementing callbacks.

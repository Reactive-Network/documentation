## Overview

Reactive Contracts send **cross-chain callback transactions** to destination chains. By default, callbacks are delivered through the Reactive **Callback Proxy**. Hyperlane Mailboxes provide an alternative transport for these callbacks. The Mailbox contract on each supported chain acts as the entry and exit point for cross-chain messages.

Reactive Contracts still listen to event logs and trigger actions in the same way, only the callback transport changes. Hyperlane transport is useful when:

- A chain does not yet support the Callback Proxy
- You need additional routing flexibility
- You want to integrate Reactive Contracts with existing Hyperlane-based systems

## Overview

An alternative to Reactive transport can be Hyperlane Mailboxes. Hyperlane is a modular interoperability protocol for cross-chain messaging. Its core component, the Mailbox contract, is deployed on each supported blockchain. The Mailbox acts as both the entry and exit point for cross-chain messages, allowing smart contracts to transmit and receive data across networks.

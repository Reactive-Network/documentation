# Relayer Network

The Relayer Network is currently in the design phase. Cross-chain functionalities are a part of the Reactive Network node software and will be decoupled in the future.

The Relayer Network should serve as a vital layer within the Reactive Network architecture, tasked with two primary functions:

* Achieving consensus on events originating from external ecosystems, such as Origin Chain Contracts and Destination Chain Contracts. This ensures that these events are accurately processed and unanimously agreed upon by the network.

* Hosting the Interoperability Service, which acts as a facilitator for interoperability between diverse chains or networks.

This service communication and data transfer between the Reactive Network and external entities, such as Celestia and Arbitrum Nova.

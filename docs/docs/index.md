## Overview

Reactive Network is an EVM-compatible chain built around Reactive Contracts (RCs) — event-driven smart contracts for cross-chain, on-chain automation.

Reactive Contracts monitor event logs across EVM chains and execute Solidity logic automatically when conditions are met. Instead of waiting for users or bots to trigger transactions, RCs run continuously and decide when to send cross-chain callback transactions — essentially providing **if-this-then-that automation for smart contracts**.

This makes it possible to build conditional cross-chain workflows such as:

* Automated stop-loss and take-profit orders
* Liquidation protection
* Automated portfolio rebalancing
* Yield optimization
* Cross-chain workflows

## Step 1 — Reactive Basics

[Origins & Destinations →](./origins-and-destinations.mdx) Understand origin and destination chains and their Callback Proxy addresses.

[Hyperlane →](./hyperlane.mdx) Learn how cross-chain callbacks are transported using Hyperlane.

[Reactive Contracts →](./reactive-contracts.md) Learn how Reactive Contracts subscribe to events and trigger actions.

[ReactVM →](./reactvm.md) Understand ReactVM and how Reactive execution works.

[Economy →](./economy) Understand callback payments and Reactive's economy.

## Step 2 — Reactive Essentials

[Reactive Mainnet & Lasna Testnet →](./reactive-mainnet.mdx) Connect to Reactive Mainnet or Lasna Testnet.

[Reactive Library →](./reactive-lib.mdx) Use Reactive abstract contracts and interfaces.

[Events & Callbacks →](./events-and-callbacks.md) Learn how event subscriptions trigger cross-chain callbacks. 

[Subscriptions →](./subscriptions.md) Configure event subscriptions.

[RNK RPC Methods →](./rnk-rpc-methods.md) Reference RPC methods for Reactive nodes.

## Step 3 — Reactive Building

[Reactive Demos →](./demos.md) Explore working examples. 

[Reactive Demos on GitHub →](https://github.com/Reactive-Network/reactive-smart-contract-demos) Clone demo projects and start building.

## Extra
